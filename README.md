# Word2Vec Embedding Analysis

## Overview

This project involves training word embeddings using the Word2Vec method and evaluating them against pre-trained Google News embeddings. The task includes preprocessing text data, training Word2Vec models, visualizing embeddings, evaluating word similarities, and analyzing results.

## Project Structure

- `A1_helper.py`: Provided helper module for visualizing word embeddings.
- `preprocess.py`: Script for preprocessing text data (lowercasing, lemmatization, etc.).
- `train_embeddings.py`: Script for training Word2Vec embeddings in two different ways.
- `evaluate_embeddings.py`: Script for evaluating word similarities and computing Pearson correlation coefficient.
- `visualize_embeddings.py`: Script for generating 2D visualizations of word embeddings.
- `word_embeddings_1.txt`: First set of learned word embeddings (plain text).
- `word_embeddings_2.txt`: Second set of learned word embeddings (plain text).
- `similarity_dataset.txt`: Custom dataset with word pairs and similarity scores.
- `report.pdf`: PDF report with descriptions, results, and analysis.
